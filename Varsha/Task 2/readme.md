Suggestions to overcome lag in the real-time feed of the webcam:

1. Lowering the resolution of the webcam can decrease in lag of the real-time feed.
2. Increasing the brightness of the room
3. Webcams need an Internet speed of 128Mbps or more to provide lag-free feed, so ensuring that the Internet requirements are met would help.
4. Reducing the system's graphics hardware acceleration
5. Closing all memory-intensive programs and web browsers
6. Updating the webcam drivers
7. Increasing the device's frame rate
8. Increasing the priority of the process running the webcam
9. Using threads and imutils library

Method 8 was implemented and the video without lag has been saved.
